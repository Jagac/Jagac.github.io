							<h2>About me</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							People often asked what I wanted to do with my economics degree and I never had a real answer until I found data science.
							I will never forget when my economics professor told me that as a data analyst I could make a financial statement in 5 lines of code and I was hooked.
							Next, I was invited to join a data analysis bootcamp where my professor and alumni showed me the powers of SQL and Python. 
							Learning packages such as Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn and meeting the analysts themselves made me excited to be a member of such a diverse community. 
							In data science I see a purposeful and versatile vocation, yet what I love most about it is the fusion of an interdisciplinary approach with a focus on innovation.
							I am currently working on my MS in Data Science at The University of Rochester. Since I have a ton of experience working
							with structured data, I am interested in expading more into working with unstructured data.
